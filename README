Title: Nozama Online simulation.
Author: Vincent Bett:
Purpose:
	To simulate the operations of an order processing facility for 
	a top online retailer by tracking the life of an order.

		Header file for Ordequeue.cpp
	OrderQueue.cpp
		File that implements my queue to store the
		orders

		once done
	Fetcher.h
		header file for fetcher.cpp
	Fetcher.cpp

		the incoming class
	Parser.h

	incomingOrders.h
		Header file for incomingOrders.cpp
	IncomingOrders.cpp
		File that accepts orders from the user
	string2Int.h
		header file for string2int.cpp
	string2int.cpp
		Convert from string to an integer.
	main.cpp
		File that aggregates all the other files and runs the program.
		
Data structures Used.

Linked list.
	Used to store the incoming orders.
queue
	I used it to simplify the process of removing an order from the
	front of the list.
stack
	Modified my queue to only remove from the front so that I could pass it 
	to packer.
	
Algorithm Used.
	For this project I have a "master clock" that runs independently.
	the other classes then check the time and either remove an order or take
        an order.Once the order has gone through its life cycle it is removed 
        from the system and printed.
TO compile type:
